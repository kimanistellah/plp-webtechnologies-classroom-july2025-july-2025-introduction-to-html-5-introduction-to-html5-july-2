    <p>
        Why does the void hum so low,<br>
        as if it buried its voice in snow?<br>
        Galaxies swirl, yet hush remains- <br>
        no welcome note, no cosmic refrain.<br>

        Do distant minds sleep, or hide, or watch?<br>
        Or has silence outlived every spoken touch?<br>
        We scan with light, we beam with song,<br>
        but quiet answers all along.<br>

        So we question not just stars, but fate-<br> 
        is quiet a warning...or a gate?
